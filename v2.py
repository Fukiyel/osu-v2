__name__ = "osu!v2 - An osu! alternative system by Fukiyel (W.I.P.)"
__doc__ = """
osu!v2 is a concept meant to surpass osu!'s current system.
'System' include Star Rating, PP calculation, Mods options & effects, Scoring, etc.

It is a W.I.P., and I'm currently working on Star Rating calculation.
It will be separated into different aspects like Speed and Stamina, which are respectively in version v5 and v8.
- Speed measures difficulty to click really fast during a short time.
- Stamina measures difficulty to click fast during a long time.

FT, or FastTime is a new mod that increases a map's speed (N.B. not talking about Speed difficulty) by 25%.
It is a between of No-mod and DT.


Functions :
	osu_map() -> Returns the entire string of a map's file
	objects() -> Returns the objects of a map and separate their parameters
	active_objects() -> Filter only clickable objects
	timestamps() -> Returns timestamps of objects
	periods() -> Turns timestamps into periods

	ht() -> Divide periods by .75
	ft() -> Divide periods by 1.25
	dt() -> Divide periods by 1.5

	raw_speed() -> Corresponding raw speed values of entered periods
	speed_blocks() -> Makes blocks of raw speed values
	speed_weighting() -> Weights speed blocks depending of their length
	speed() -> Takes active timestamps and returns weighted speed blocks
	global_speed() -> Turns speed values into a unique one

	absolute_stamina() -> Returns stamina changes of entered periods
	relative_stamina() -> Applies stamina changes to periods
	stamina() -> Takes active timestamps and returns their relative stamina
	global_stamina() -> Turns stamina values into a unique one
