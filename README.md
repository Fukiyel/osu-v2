# osu!v2, concept by Fukiyel
osu!v2 is a system meant to surpass actual osu! systems, as for Star Rating, Performance Points calculation, Score, etc.
It will also change some things about gameplay, and mapping. No "extra" features will be added if it isn't a simple amelioration of what already exists.
